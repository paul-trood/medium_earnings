# Medium Earnings Analysis  

This project tracks and analyzes my Medium Partner Program earnings and engagement over time. The dataset is manually recorded each month and does **not** use any APIs or automated data extraction methods.  

## 📊 About the Dataset  

The data consists of key Medium writing business metrics, including:  

- **earnings**: Total revenue earned from Medium  
- **followers**: Total number of followers  
- **follower_gain (change)**: Net increase or decrease in followers  
- **email_subscribers**: Number of email subscribers  
- **views**: Total article views  
- **reads**: Total article reads  
- **number_articles**: Number of articles published  
- **avg_earnings_per_article**: (`earnings / number_articles`)  
- **avg_read_ratio**: (`reads / views`)  

### **⚠️ Data Collection Method**  
This dataset is **manually recorded** by me each month. No APIs, scraping, or automated extraction methods were used. While not the most efficient approach in a developer or work environment, the dataset is small, and tracking it only takes about **5 minutes per month**. Moving forward, I plan to continue this manual tracking method.  

## 🚀 Goals  

- **Analyze earnings trends** over time  
- **Explore engagement metrics** to identify patterns  
- **Create visualizations** to track progress  

## 📌 Future Enhancements
  
- Develop a **dashboard** for real-time tracking
