# Understanding Medium's Earnings and Engagement Metrics

This supplemental document expands on key aspects of the dataset, providing deeper insights into how Medium calculates earnings, the significance of different metrics, and how they relate to content performance.
### Earnings: A Cumulative and Algorithmic System

Earnings are not solely based on new content. Articles written months ago can still generate revenue if they continue receiving engagement.
Medium’s earning algorithm is opaque. While exact details are unknown, it factors in:
* Read time (how long someone stays on an article).
* Claps (likes), responses, and follows.
* Whether a paying Medium member engages with the story.
    
Revenue varies by article. A high-view article might not earn much if engagement is low, whereas a well-read article with fewer views can generate substantial earnings.

### Follower Count vs. Actual Engagement

A large follower base does not guarantee high earnings or reads. Many followers do not consistently engage.
Unlike email subscribers, who receive direct notifications when a story is published, followers only see new content in their feed—if the algorithm favors it.

### Views vs. Reads: The Critical Difference

Views count as clicks but do not reflect actual engagement. Someone could click and leave in seconds, generating no revenue.
Reads are when Medium determines a user spent enough time (30 seconds or more) engaging with the content—this is the key driver of earnings.
Read Ratio (reads/views) is a strong indicator of an article’s effectiveness at keeping readers engaged. More specifically, for example, a read ratio of 68% means of all the people who clicked on the article headline, 68% of them continued to read for 30 seconds or more.

### General Trends

Earnings fluctuations are common and depending on any changes Medium is makin with how readers interact with content or how they calculate earnings, this may be affected.
More published articles generally increase reads—but only if they maintain quality and engagement.

This document should serve as a reference when analyzing trends in the dataset. Future insights may explore deeper correlations, predictive modeling, and how engagement strategies impact earnings.


May 2024 Article insights: A lot of the things I wrote about were in response to things I learned about myself and relationships from previous experiences in the last few months before May

June 2024: My two highest performing articles were based on a very recent experience I had with someone who had a major impact on the way I look at life and relationships.

July 2024: Again, my highest performing stories were refinements and iterations of that previous experience, another topic, "Toxic People" was further refined in July

August 2024: Many high-performing articles relating to Attachment theory. I think I started to connect the dots here from that recent experience with other experiences I had years prior, when I struggled to articulate attachment theory

September 2024: Compared to August 2024, which had several exceedingly high performing stories, in September 2024 I had stories that didn't earn as much but I put out A LOT of content that seemed to spread out a little bit more on earnings (Quantity vs. Quality). It doesn't look like there's as much on attachment theory compared to August 2024

October 2024: Stories clearly underperformed, but ironically, compared to September 2024 I had VERY high perfomring articles. Two stories that earned over $100 each and a $40 story.

November 2024: Most of my higher performing stories were focused more on general relationship advice because I didn't write too many stories on attachment theory.

December 2024: This month was absolutely abysmal as far as earnings went. My highest earning story was only $27 but it was at least a story about attachment theory dynamics

January 2025: Stats for January were similar to December 2024. I think what happens is I over-estimate how much I write about attachment theory/dynamics and actually end up under-estimating that and in January I was mostly writing about general relationship dynamics, especially around things like toxic partners or listicles. And in january, I made the least amount that I had for quite a while since September 2024.

February 2025:Earnings jumped back up to my usual "400$ per month" My two highest perfomring articles in this month included things about attachment theory and toxic behavior.

March 2025: by march I've cut down on the number of articles I've written to about 15. There weren't many "stand-out" articles except one or two, with the highest earning one being about attachment
