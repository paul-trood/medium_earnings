# Understanding Medium's Earnings and Engagement Metrics

This supplemental document expands on key aspects of the dataset, providing deeper insights into how Medium calculates earnings, the significance of different metrics, and how they relate to content performance.
### Earnings: A Cumulative and Algorithmic System

Earnings are not solely based on new content. Articles written months ago can still generate revenue if they continue receiving engagement.
Medium’s earning algorithm is opaque. While exact details are unknown, it factors in:
* Read time (how long someone stays on an article).
* Claps (likes), responses, and follows.
* Whether a paying Medium member engages with the story.
    
Revenue varies by article. A high-view article might not earn much if engagement is low, whereas a well-read article with fewer views can generate substantial earnings.

### Follower Count vs. Actual Engagement

A large follower base does not guarantee high earnings or reads. Many followers do not consistently engage.
Unlike email subscribers, who receive direct notifications when a story is published, followers only see new content in their feed—if the algorithm favors it.

### Views vs. Reads: The Critical Difference

Views count as clicks but do not reflect actual engagement. Someone could click and leave in seconds, generating no revenue.
Reads are when Medium determines a user spent enough time (30 seconds or more) engaging with the content—this is the key driver of earnings.
Read Ratio (reads/views) is a strong indicator of an article’s effectiveness at keeping readers engaged. More specifically, for example, a read ratio of 68% means of all the people who clicked on the article headline, 68% of them continued to read for 30 seconds or more.

### General Trends

Earnings fluctuations are common and depending on any changes Medium is makin with how readers interact with content or how they calculate earnings, this may be affected.
More published articles generally increase reads—but only if they maintain quality and engagement.
