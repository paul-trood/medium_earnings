analysis of the earnings drop is closely tied to a broader trend among Medium writers, and it would be interesting to frame this in the dashboard or report to highlight the impact of Medium's changes on earnings. Given the context of the “interesting” times for Medium, this shift might be due to several factors:
Potential Factors to Consider in Your Analysis:

    Algorithm Changes:

        Medium could have adjusted their algorithm, making it harder for new articles or writers to get noticed. This often happens with platforms that rely on recommendation systems, where changes can directly affect traffic and earnings.

    Platform Policy Changes:

        Medium may have made changes to their monetization policies (e.g., reducing the earnings per view, making it harder to earn money per subscriber or article). This could explain why many writers have seen a sharp drop in earnings.

    Increased Competition:

        There could be more writers on Medium now, making it more difficult to stand out. The platform may have grown exponentially, but the payout system hasn’t kept up with the increased competition.

    Engagement Decline:

        A drop in engagement could also lead to lower earnings. If Medium readers are spending less time on the platform or interacting less with posts, your views and earnings would likely drop as well.

How to Frame This in Your Analysis:

    Highlight the Peak:

        Start by clearly marking the peak (September) and the subsequent sharp decline in October. A visual (like an annotated line graph or bar chart) would really make this clear. Highlight the 30% drop in earnings as a reference point and add a brief explanation in your report about what happened during that period.

    Comparison to Other Writers:

        If you have access to any data or anecdotal information from other Medium writers (perhaps from forums, social media, etc.), you could compare your earnings decline to a broader trend. A community-driven insight would validate that this isn’t just a one-off event for you but a platform-wide issue.

    Trend Analysis:

        Show the consistent decline over time, potentially breaking it down month-by-month, and highlight when Medium made any notable changes or updates (whether public or inferred from the community). This could correlate with the sharp drops.

    Include a Commentary Section:

        In your dashboard or report, include a section or annotation that addresses the "interesting times" at Medium. This gives context to the numbers and offers an explanation for the trends you’re seeing. It also makes the data less of a “cold” statistic and more of a living, breathing reflection of the challenges you and others are facing.

    Projections and Hypotheses:

        If you're inclined, consider creating some projections for how earnings might change in the next few months based on current trends. You can also hypothesize about what might improve, e.g., a change in Medium’s policies or algorithms, or if other writers are starting to see a recovery.

How to Visualize This on Your Dashboard:

    Line Chart with Annotations:

        You can create a line chart that tracks your earnings over time with clear markers indicating the peak and the fall. Add annotations to those key points for clarity, such as "Peak Earnings (Sept)" and "30% Decline (Oct)".

    Bar Chart with Color Coding:

        For the months that had sharp declines, you could use color-coded bars (e.g., red for negative changes) to emphasize the drop.

    Community Sentiment/Commentary:

        Consider adding a visual element that reflects the broader sentiment, such as a sentiment analysis of Medium writer communities, or a word cloud of terms that are most frequently mentioned by writers discussing earnings loss (e.g., “algorithm change,” “earnings cut,” “visibility”).

Example of a Caption for This Analysis:

    "After peaking in September 2023, earnings took a sharp 30% decline in October, which has since continued. Other writers across the Medium platform have similarly experienced these drops, likely due to a combination of Medium's changing algorithms, decreased platform engagement, and adjustments to the partner program. Despite these challenges, this analysis reveals key insights into the broader trend and the persistent impact of these changes on earnings."

What You Can Do Next:

    Document Your Observations:

        For your report, document your findings on why you think this decline happened. It would add depth to your analysis and could provide valuable insights for others in your situation.

    Consider Alternative Revenue Models:

        While you’re analyzing the earnings drop, it could also be worth researching ways to diversify your revenue streams, such as incorporating affiliate marketing, diversifying platforms, or working with other content monetization methods that could buffer against Medium’s uncertainties.
